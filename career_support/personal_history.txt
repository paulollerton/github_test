One of the challenges that has made a big impact is hubris. I definitely grew up with a static intelligence mindset, and it really didnt serve me. Because I had a relatively easy time with schoolwork and test well, I developed the belief that my intelligence was innate and that things would always come easily to me. This became less and less true over time, and when I got to college I suddenly realized that I needed to learn how to study, ask for help, and listen. These were hard things to learn, and I'll admit that I still struggle with them now.

However, I've definitely improved and will continue to do so. I've come to value hard work, curiosity, and empathy and have tried to make them my guiding principles. As a result my personal relationships have improved, I've learned how to work as part of a team, and I'm finally learning how to learn; which will allow me to reach my goals.

The thing I appreciate most about myself is my capacity for empathy, though I haven't always related to it in a healthy way. I grew up believing that service to others trumps everything, even to the detriment of my own quality of life. For a while, this led to me withdrawing from the world as much as I could to avoid having to help people at my own expense because I had burned out and just didn't have it in me anymore. I've learned since then that I can help out as long as I respect my own boundaries, and now find fulfillment fostering dogs among other things.

At this point I've found ways to appreciate most of my attributes, but I don't like how much of a perfectionist I can be. I like to be right, and I've always had trouble accepting constructive criticism. This is the part of the growth mindset that I'll need to work on the most.

I spent 6 years in the Marines, and definitely felt uncomfortable, anxious and frustrated on a regular basis. It's a harsh environment, to say the least. I spent most of that time feeling very tense and on edge, but dealt with it by striving to do what was expected of me while deveolping a thick enough skin to handle the frequent criticism. It served me at the time but I've been working on a gentler mindset since then.
